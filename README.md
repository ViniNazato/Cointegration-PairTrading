# Cointegration-PairTrading

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources related to Cointegration Pair Trading. The purpose of this project is to explore and implement pair trading strategies based on cointegration analysis.
Pair trading is a popular trading strategy that involves taking positions in two correlated securities to take advantage of relative price movements. Cointegration analysis helps identify pairs of assets that move together over time, making them suitable candidates for pair trading strategies.

This repository provides code and tools for implementing cointegration-based pair trading strategies. It includes scripts for data analysis, strategy development, and backtesting.
